# FINAL
The Fire Including Natural &amp; Agricultural Lands model, along with optimization code.

v1.0.0 contains code as used in [my dissertation](http://dataspace.princeton.edu/jspui/handle/88435/dsp01k3569674p), which was also used in the initial submission of the manuscript, ["A fire model with distinct crop, pasture, and non-agricultural burning: Use of new data and a model-fitting algorithm for FINALv1."](http://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2017-77).

Note that only the fire module of LM3 is included here. The complete model is distributed as part of AM3, for which access instructions can be found on the [GFDL website](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/am3/). The codebase used in the above publication contains some small changes to the non-fire parts of LM3; these are detailed in the paper itself.
